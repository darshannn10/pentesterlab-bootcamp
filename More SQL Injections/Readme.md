### The Anti Security Movement

The **Anti Security Movement**, or simply, **antisec**, is a movement fundamentally opposed to the cybersecurity industry. Beginnings of the Anti Security Movement started in the late 1990s.

The movement rejects full disclosure, claiming that cybersecurity professionals use full disclosure as a means for profit and fearmongering. Antisec supporters maintain that full disclosure is used to convince businesses and individuals to unnecessarily purchase firewalls, antivirus software, and auditing services.

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on IP networks. DHCP operates based on the client-server model. DHCP can be implemented on home networks all the way up to regional internet service provider (ISP) networks.

After a host machine installs the DHCP service, it becomes a DHCP server. This server automatically assigns IP addresses, default gateways, and other network devices to each host on the network. As a result, each host can communicate efficiently with other endpoints.

The primary purpose of DHCP is to simplify IP address management on a network. For example, no two hosts can share the same IP address on a network – this becomes a task managed by the DHCP server. A DHCP server will usually assign each host with a unique dynamic IP address which can change when the host's lease for that IP address has expired.

In the absence of a DHCP server, a network administrator would have to manually set up every host that joins a network – a maintenance nightmare.

### File Transfer Protocol

The **File Transfer Protocol** (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server on a computer network. FTP was invented in 1971, created and published by Abhay Bhushan as [RFC 114](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114). For secure transmission, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

An FTP server offers access to a directory with sub-directories. Users are able to connect to these servers with an FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, WinSCP, etc.) to upload and download files from the server.

### Request for Comments

Request for Comments (RFC) is a type of publication, generally authored by engineers or computer scientists, in the form of a memorandum. It describes methods, research, or implementation details in an area related to the internet or internet-connected systems. Some famous examples of RFCs include:

- [RFC 791: IP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791)
- [RFC 793: TCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793)
- [RFC 1034: DNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034)
- [RFC 4291: IPv6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291)

The purpose of an RFC is to seek feedback, prompt rigorous discussion, and reach technical verification from other professionals on the subject. As a result, an RFC may then accepted as an official protocol recognised by the IETF, becoming a standard implmeneted by software vendors.
